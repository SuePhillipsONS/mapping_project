# mapping_project

This code will allow you to display two datasets on their own map side by side.

In order for your datasets to correctly display on the maps they must have a geometry column. 
If you only have X and Y co-ordinates you can use the code included in the jupiter file to create the geometry column.

Please enter the name of your datasets as you want them to appear on the maps in the code: name_1 = , and name_2 = .

Please add your dataset file path in the code as: dataset_1 = , and dataset_2 = .
