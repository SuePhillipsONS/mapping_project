# Project to display two datsets on side by side maps

## Section 1. This code will allow you to display two datasets on their own map side by side.

In order for your datasets to correctly display on the maps they must have a geometry column. 
If you only have X and Y co-ordinates you can use the code included in the jupiter file to create the geometry column.

Please enter the name of your datasets as you want them to appear on the maps in the code: name_1 = , and name_2 = .

Please add your dataset file path in the code as: dataset_1 = , and dataset_2 = .

The final step will save a local copy of the maps and open them in a pop-up window.

## Section 2. This code will compare the datasets using specific columns.

This will compare how many records are in both datasets.
